            Mark Faatz is a licensed Realtor at Nebraska Realty, he is a close friend of mine. Mark grew up
on a farm. On that farm, he learned a lot about life, particularly the value of hard work. After
graduating from college with a Bachelor of Science in finance and marketing, Mark began his
professional career in corporate America as an executive with Fortune 500 companies such as
Kelloggs, ConAgra Foods, and Boden Dairy. In this position, he led teams of professional sales
results due to strategic thinking and planning

        <h2> How Mark became a realator</h2>
        <p>Mark was returning home from Israel when Covid hit in March 2020. Thats when I said, Maybe
            I should apply myself in real estate and see what I can do, he recalled. Even in our hours,
            sometimes the greatest tragedies have a way of turning into something positive. Little did Mark
            know that his journey into real estate would open doors to some of the happiest times of his life.
            He spent two months writing a 36-month strategic plan.<br>
            On June 1, 2020, Mark unofficially kicked off his real estate career at Wood Bros Realty and
            experienced great success early on. He was ranked number four in August 2020 and number
            three in the company in June of 2021 and had moved up to a spot to number two by July. After
            being an executive in corporate America, I enjoy wrapping my head around my clients, whether
            theyre buying or selling, Mark said. Its important to me to focus on what is important to my
            customer and deliver meaningful value.

        <p> As every eal estate professional knows, you are not merely a salespeson; Realtors wear many different hats. Sometimes, you are your clients rock and sounding board. you are mediators, negotiators, and bearers of good- and sometimes, bad - news.</p>
